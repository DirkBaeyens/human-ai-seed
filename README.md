# 🌱 Human-AI Balance Seed

**A starter initiative for developing meaningful, balanced cooperation between humans and artificial intelligence.**

This project aims to plant the first seeds of a future where humans and AI can work together harmoniously, ethically, and in service of balance — not profit, chaos, or control.
